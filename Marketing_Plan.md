## Child Development Tracker Application

**Prepared by:** Claude Code

## Executive Summary

This marketing plan outlines low-cost, high-impact strategies for launching and growing Toddl, a child development tracker application. The plan leverages organic growth tactics, community building, and strategic partnerships to acquire users while maintaining minimal marketing spend.

**Target Audience:** Parents of toddlers (ages 0-5 years), especially mothers anxious about whether their child's development is on track

- Shows parents what milestones to expect next and if their child is on track
- Provides proactive activities and toys to help if milestones are delayed - BEFORE the next doctor visit
- Privacy-first: AI analyzes medical developmental history only, not personal identifiable information
- NOT a photo storage app - focused on supporting development, not documenting it
