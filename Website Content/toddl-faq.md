## Getting Started

### What is toddl.health?

Toddl.health is an AI-powered developmental milestone tracking app that provides personalized activity recommendations for your child. Unlike generic trackers, our AI analyzes your child's medical history and developmental stage to deliver hyper-personalized guidance, answer "Is my baby on track?", and recommend specific activities to support development.

### How is toddl different from other milestone tracking apps?

Toddl is the only app that uses AI to personalize recommendations based on YOUR child's medical history, not generic advice. We provide clear "on track" status answers, specific activities for delayed milestones, predictive "what's next" insights, and privacy-first AI (medical developmental history only, no photos or personal identifiable information).

## Privacy & Data Security

### What data does toddl collect?

Toddl collects medical developmental history, your child's due date, developmental milestone progress, completed activities, and relevant medical context. We do NOT collect photos, videos, location data, or other personal identifiable information. Your privacy is our priority.

### How do you protect my child's medical data?

Toddl uses GDPR-compliant data storage with end-to-end encryption. Your data is never shared with third parties, and never sold. You control your data with easy export and deletion options.

### Why do you need my child's medical history?

Medical history enables AI personalization that generic apps can't provide. Our AI uses this context to provide tailored activity recommendations specific to YOUR child's situation.

### Can I delete my data?

Yes, you have complete control over your data. You can export all your data anytime in standard formats, or request permanent deletion. When you delete your account, all medical history, milestone data, and activity records are permanently removed from our servers within 30 days, in compliance with GDPR.

### Do you share data with pediatricians or healthcare providers?

No, toddl does not automatically share data with healthcare providers. You control all data sharing. You can generate detailed milestone reports to bring to pediatrician appointments, but we never share information without your explicit permission. Your medical data stays private and under your control.

## Using Toddl

### What devices does toddl work on?

Toddl is available on iOS and Android smartphones.

### How often should I use toddl?

Use toddl as often as helpful for your family. Many parents check daily for activity ideas, while others review weekly when tracking milestones. We recommend logging milestone achievements when they happen by checking "Milestone Achieved" status.

### Can I add activities or milestones that aren't in the app?

Currently, toddl uses evidence-based developmental milestone standards from CDC, AAP, and WHO guidelines. While you can't add custom milestones in V1, you can mark activities as completed and track progress. We're considering custom milestone and activity features for future versions based on user feedback.

### What if I disagree with the AI's assessment?

The AI provides guidance based on developmental norms and your child's context, but every child develops uniquely. If you have concerns about your child's development, always consult your pediatrician. Toddl complements professional medical advice but never replaces it. Trust your parental instinct and seek professional evaluation when needed.

## AI & Personalization

### How does the AI personalization work?

Toddl's AI analyzes your child's milestone status, medical history (premature birth, delays, family patterns), milestone completion history, and activity responses to generate personalized activity and toy/tools recommendations.

### What if my child was born premature?

Toddl accounts for adjusted age in premature babies. When you input prematurity in medical history, the AI automatically adjusts milestone expectations and activity recommendations based on corrected age, not chronological age. This ensures accurate "on track" assessments and developmentally appropriate activity suggestions for preemies.

### Can toddl help with developmental delays?

Yes, toddl is specifically designed to help parents support children with developmental delays. When milestones are delayed, the AI recommends targeted activities to encourage skill development in specific areas. However, toddl complements but doesn't replace occupational therapy, speech therapy, or other professional interventions. Always consult healthcare providers for developmental concerns.

### What activities does toddl recommend?

Toddl recommends evidence-based activities tailored to your child's current developmental stage and areas needing support. Activities range from simple play ideas you can do at home with household items to specific exercises targeting motor skills, language development, cognitive growth, and social-emotional skills. Each activity includes clear instructions and developmental benefits.
