Developmental Milestone,About
Baby will lift their head up briefly while lying on their tummy,"About
Around the 1-month mark, your baby might start to briefly lift their head when placed on their tummy. It’s usually just a few seconds at a time a little bob upward but it’s a big first step in building the neck and upper body strength they’ll need for later milestones like rolling, sitting, and crawling. The baby crying out of discomfet durring tummy time is absolutely normal but do trust your gut and visit a GP or a PHN if you feel something is wrong.

What to look for:
- Baby may turn their head side to side while on their tummy.
- Head may lift slightly off the floor for a second or two wobbly but determined.
- You might see their arms starting to push a little too, though not strongly yet.

Why it matters:
This isn’t just about neck muscles it’s about developing coordination, body awareness, and endurance. It also helps prevent flat spots on the back of their head from too much time lying on their back.

You may notice that your baby can grip small objects in their hands, like your finger."
Baby's fists begin to loosen,"About
Newborns are born with high flexor tone and a strong palmar grasp reflex, so those tight little fists are normal. Around 4 weeks (give or take), that reflex begins to ease and muscle tone starts to balance out. What this really means is your baby’s hands will open more often, the thumb will separate from the palm, and the fingers will briefly splay or wiggle. This is the groundwork for everything that follows: reaching, grasping, bringing hands to mouth, and eventually holding toys.

What to look for
- Hands not always clenched. During calm, awake moments you’ll see the hands open a bit—maybe 20–50% of the time—then close again.
- Thumb coming out of the palm. Less “thumb-in” fisting, more open, relaxed hand.
- Hands to midline or mouth. Briefly bringing hands together on the chest or toward the mouth, especially while settling.
- Symmetry. Both hands loosening in a similar way (perfectly identical isn’t required).
- Short “holds.” Baby may lightly “catch” your finger or a soft cloth, then let go.

Why it matters
- Sensory learning. Open hands let babies feel textures, temperature, and their own skin—huge for brain development.
- Self-soothing. Hands to mouth is a powerful regulator.
- Motor foundation. Looser hands precede purposeful grasping (around 3–4 months) and coordinated reaching (around 4 months).
- Early screen for issues. Persistent tight fisting or clear asymmetry can flag something worth checking early, when help is most effective."
Baby recognises your voice and enjoys when you chat and sing,"About 
From day one, babies are tuned to human voices, especially the familiar ones they heard in the womb. In the first weeks they’ll quiet, brighten, or settle when they hear you. By 6–8 weeks many start “talking back” with coos, and by 3–4 months they actively seek your voice, 

What to look for
State change with your voice. Baby pauses, quiets, or perks up when you speak nearby, even if they can’t see you.
Orientation. Brief head turn or eye shift toward the sound by around 3–4 months.
Face brightening. Widened eyes, stilling of the body, soft kicks, or a half-smile when you start talking or singing.
Vocal “answers.” Little coos, sighs, or grunts after you speak, early turn-taking.
Preference. Calmer with you than with background chatter; favorite lullabies get faster smiles or quicker settling over time.

Why it matters
Bonding and regulation. Your voice is a built-in calmer and anchor in a noisy world.
Language wiring. Every chat builds sound mapping, rhythm, and attention, the scaffolding for words later.
Social skills. Turn-taking with sounds is the earliest “conversation.”
Listening practice. Locating and tracking a voice trains auditory attention."
Baby likes hearing people’s voices and prefers high-pitched voices,"About the milestone

Newborns are wired for human voices. They detect rhythm, pitch, and sing-song patterns from birth, and they often prefer higher-pitched, exaggerated speech (the classic “parentese”). Here’s the thing: that lilting tone isn’t silly—it’s a neon sign for the newborn brain, making your words easier to notice and process.

What to look for
- State change to voices. Quieting, brighter eyes, stilling, or happy wiggles when someone starts talking nearby.
- Preference for “sing-song.” More focus, longer gaze, quicker settling with expressive, higher-pitched speech than with flat, adult-to-adult talk.
- Early social cues. Wide eyes, half-smiles, coos after you speak; brief pauses as if taking turns.
- Orientation. By ~3–4 months, brief head/eye turn toward the familiar voice.
- Pattern learning. Favorite songs/phrases start to calm faster over time.

Why it matters
- Attention hook. Higher pitch + clear rhythm pulls focus in a world full of noise.
- Language scaffolding. Exaggerated melody helps babies hear syllables, stress, and word boundaries—foundation for speech later.
- Bonding + regulation. Your voice is a portable comforter that helps down-shift stress.
- Listening skills. Tracking where a voice comes from trains auditory localization and sustained attention."
Baby is startled by loud noises,"About the milestone

The startle (Moro) reflex is built-in. A sudden loud sound can trigger a full-body “whoa”: arms fling out, hands open, then arms fold back in, often with a quick cry. It’s most obvious in the first weeks and gradually fades as the nervous system matures.

Typical range: present from birth, strongest in the first 4–6 weeks, and usually integrates by 3–6 months. Preterm babies follow their corrected age timeline.

What to look for

Classic pattern. Arms fly out and open, then return to the body; brief cry, quick recovery.

Blink/alerting. A clear blink or pause to a sharp clap or dropped book (not right next to the ear).

Habituation. With the same sound repeated a few times, the reaction should shrink.

State matters. Bigger startles when baby is overtired, falling asleep, or just waking.

Symmetry. Both arms/legs move similarly. Perfect mirror image isn’t required, but clear one-sidedness isn’t typical.

Short and stimulus-linked. It happens right after the sound and lasts a second or two.

Why it matters

Hearing check. Startling to loud sounds tells you baby is detecting them.

Brain development. Over time the reflex quiets and is replaced by purposeful orienting (turning head toward sounds).

Self-regulation practice. Recovering from small startles builds coping skills for bigger sensations later."
Baby cries to communicate their needs,"Baby cries to communicate their needs
About the milestone

Crying is a newborn’s first language. From birth, it’s how they say “I’m hungry,” “I’m tired,” “I’m overstimulated,” or “Something hurts.” There isn’t a universal cry dictionary—each baby’s signals are a little different—but patterns emerge fast when you watch and respond.

Typical range: crying starts day one, often peaks around 6–8 weeks, then eases by 3–4 months as other signals (coos, smiles, more organized routines) kick in. Premature babies follow their corrected age timeline.

What to look for

Different “flavors” of cry

Hunger: rhythmic, builds steadily; rooting/hand-to-mouth, head turning.

Tired/overstimulated: fuss → whining cry, rubbing eyes/ears, staring away, hiccups.

Discomfort/gas: strained face, pulling legs up, grunty bursts.

Pain/ill: sudden, sharp, higher-pitched; baby looks tense or inconsolable.

Body + face clues: color change, grimace, splayed fingers, arching, clenched fists.

Escalation curve: brief fuss → cry → wail if needs aren’t met. Quicker escalation when overtired.

Consolability: settles with a consistent response (feeding, holding, swaddling, motion, sucking).

Daily pattern: more crying late afternoon/evening is common (“witching hour”).

Your baby’s signature: timing, pitch, and what soothes them—this is your playbook.

Why it matters

Survival + attachment: your prompt, warm response teaches “When I signal, someone comes.” That’s secure bonding.

Self-regulation: being soothed repeatedly helps wire the brain for calming down later.

Communication foundation: you learn their cues; they learn that signals have outcomes—step one toward back-and-forth interaction.

Health check: changes in cry quality or consolability can flag illness or pain."
Baby cries or is upset for 2 to 3 hours a day,"About the milestone

Most healthy newborns have a daily fuss/cry window that grows through the first weeks, often peaking around 6–8 weeks, then easing by 3–4 months. Two to three hours total across the day—often stacked in the late afternoon/evening—is common. What this really means is: your baby’s nervous system is still learning to process hunger, fatigue, gas, light, and noise. Crying is the outlet.

A quick reference point: “colic” is typically defined by the rule of threes—more than 3 hours a day, 3 days a week, for 3 weeks or more, in an otherwise healthy baby.

What to look for

Patterns. Does fussing cluster at certain times (usually late afternoon)? Track for 3–4 days and you’ll see rhythms.

State change. Tired babies cry more. Watch wake windows: many newborns manage 45–90 minutes between sleeps.

Cues layered on the cry.
Hunger: rooting, hand-to-mouth, steady build.
Overtired/overstimulated: glazed look, turning away, frantic movements.
Gas/discomfort: face strain, knees up, grunty bursts.

Consolability. With the right response—feeding, holding, swaddling for sleep, motion, sucking—crying should reduce within minutes.

Escalation curve. Short fuss → cry → wail if needs stack up. Evening “witching hour” is classic.

Your baby’s signature. Pitch, timing, what soothes. Treat it like a codebook you’re learning.

Why it matters

Communication. You respond, baby learns “signals work.” That’s secure attachment 101.

Brain regulation. Repeated soothing wires the calming systems that later help with self-settling.

Health signal. Tracking typical vs. atypical crying helps you spot when something’s off."
Baby likes to look at people’s faces more than objects,"About the milestone

From birth, babies are drawn to faces—especially yours. High-contrast features (eyes, hairline, mouth) and face-like patterns grab their attention more than random objects. Over the first 8–12 weeks, this preference strengthens: they linger on faces, track you more smoothly, and start pairing faces with warm social cues (the first real smiles).

Typical range: interest in faces from birth; clear preference and longer looks by 1–3 months. Preterm babies usually follow their corrected age.

What to look for

Longer gaze on faces. Baby stares at your face longer than at a toy with similar brightness or movement.

“Face distance” sweet spot. Best engagement at 20–30 cm (about the distance from your chest to your face when held).

Eyes > everything. Frequent fixation on your eyes, hairline, or mouth; brief glances back if they look away.

Early tracking. By ~2 months, smoother side-to-side tracking of your face at close range.

State-dependent. Most interest during calm-alert periods; gaze drops when hungry, gassy, or tired.

Emerging social cues. By 6–8 weeks, brighter expression and early smiles while looking at faces.

Why it matters

Bonding + safety. Recognizing and preferring caregiver faces anchors trust and regulation.

Social brain wiring. Faces carry emotion and intent; paying attention to them lays the groundwork for joint attention and, later, language.

Vision practice. Fixating and tracking faces strengthens visual acuity and eye-movement control."
Baby can search for and suck from your breast or a bottle,"About the milestone

Newborns arrive with powerful rooting and sucking reflexes. Put simply: if something touches their cheek or lips, they turn, open wide, and try to latch. Coordination of the suck–swallow–breathe rhythm starts from birth and gets smoother over the first weeks.

Typical range: present from birth; coordination improves notably by 2–6 weeks. Preterm babies usually follow their corrected age.

What to look for

Searching (“rooting”). Turns head toward touch, opens mouth, tongue drops forward like a little scoop.

Latching. Wide gape, lips flanged out, chin pressed into breast/bottle base; cheeks rounded (not dimpled).

Rhythm. Bursts of sucks, brief pauses, then repeat. You’ll hear or see regular swallows.

Relaxed body at the end. Hands unclench, milk-dribble or sleepy “milk drunk” face.

Efficiency trends. Feeds start long and messy, then shorten and smooth out over weeks.

Bottle specifics. Minimal leaking, steady pace, no frantic gulping or coughing with an appropriate flow nipple.

Why it matters

Nutrition + growth. This is how your baby fuels brain and body.

Airway protection. Coordinated sucking and swallowing keeps milk out of the lungs.

Oral-motor foundation. The same muscles support later chewing and speech.

Bonding + regulation. Suckling, skin contact, and your smell calm the nervous system."
,
lift their chest up while lying on their tummy,"About the milestone

This is early prone extension—baby starts to push up on their forearms and lift the head and upper chest off the surface. At first it’s a quick bob; over the next few weeks it becomes a steadier prop.

Typical range: first clear chest lift shows up 6–12 weeks, gets stronger by 3 months, and by 4 months most babies can prop on elbows with the head held high. Premature babies follow their corrected age.

What to look for

Forearms under shoulders. Elbows come forward toward the chest; weight settles on the forearms, not clenched fists tucked under.

Head and chest lift. From a face-down start, baby lifts the chin, then the upper chest for a few seconds.

Smoother breathing/less face-planting. Early lifts are wobbly; by the end of month 2 they can pause and look around briefly.

Open hands. Fingers loosen and press into the surface for stability.

Short “sets.” Several 20–60 second efforts rather than one long session.

Symmetry. Both shoulders work; head can turn to both sides.

Why it matters

Neck and back strength for head control, rolling, and, later, sitting.

Shoulder and hand readiness for reaching, grasping, and protective reactions.

Sensory input to the chest, arms, and palms—big for body awareness.

Head-shape protection. Time off the back helps prevent flat spots."
keep their head in an upright position if they are being held,"About the milestone

This is early head control—your baby starts using neck and upper-back muscles to hold the head up against gravity when you hold them upright on your shoulder or in supported sitting. At first you’ll see quick bobbing and brief holds; over the next weeks the holds get steadier and longer.

Typical range: first reliable short holds around 6–10 weeks, clearly steadier by 3–4 months, and solid head control (with turns) by 5–6 months. Premature babies follow their corrected age.

What to look for

Upright on your shoulder: brief head lift to midline, a little bobbing, then a steady 3–10-second hold.

Supported sitting on your lap: less “flop forward,” chin hovers off chest, head stays mostly centered.

Turns both ways: tracks a voice/toy right and left without collapsing.

Reduced head-lag on pull-to-sit: when you gently pull from lying to sitting, the head doesn’t fully trail behind.

Works across positions: better head control on your chest/tummy time usually shows better control when held too.

Symmetry: no persistent tilt, turn, or preference to one side.

Why it matters

Airway safety. Keeping the chin off the chest protects breathing.

Vision + exploration. A steady head lets babies scan faces and the room.

Motor foundation. Sets up rolling, propping on forearms, and later sitting.

Head-shape protection. More upright time means less constant pressure on the back of the skull."
move their eyes to track an object moved past the middle of their body,"About the milestone

This is early visual tracking across midline—your baby follows something with their eyes as it moves from one side, through the center of their body (nose line), to the other side. Newborns can fix and follow a little, but often lose the target at midline. By 6–10 weeks many can follow past the middle in at least one direction; by ~3 months most babies can track both ways more smoothly and cover close to 180°. Premature babies follow their corrected age.

What to look for

Fix → follow. Baby notices the object, locks on, then eyes glide as it moves. Early on, the movement may be a bit jumpy; it smooths with practice.

Past the nose line. They don’t stop at center—they continue to the other side.

Both directions. Tracks right→left and left→right similarly (perfect symmetry isn’t required, but big differences aren’t typical).

Right distance + speed. Best at 20–30 cm away, moving slowly (think 3–4 seconds to cross their field).

Short attention windows. 2–3 good passes, then a break. Over-tired babies abandon the task quickly.

Head assist. A little head turn is fine; you’re watching the eyes do most of the work.

Why it matters

Oculomotor control. Trains the eye muscles and the “smooth pursuit” system that later helps with reading and ball play.

Binocular teamwork. Both eyes learning to work together lays groundwork for depth perception.

Attention + processing. Staying on a moving target builds sustained attention.

Early screening. Difficulty crossing midline or strong one-sidedness can hint at vision issues, a tight neck (torticollis), or a developing eye turn."
