### 1. Overview

**Product Name:** Toddl.health

### 2. Problem Statement

Parents are overwhelmed trying to track their baby's developmental milestones across multiple sources (books, websites, videos), leading to stress and information overload. Existing solutions provide generic advice that doesn't account for individual child and family medical histories, leaving parents without clear, personalized guidance on how to support their child's unique developmental journey.

---

### 3. Goals & Objectives

- Simplify milestone tracking by consolidating information into one stress-free platform
- Eliminate the need for parents to juggle multiple books, websites, and videos
- Deliver AI-powered, hyper-personalized activity recommendations ("guides") based on medical history and family context for each milestone , for each child
- Suggest relevant toys and resources tailored to each child's developmental stage
- Support parents in actively engaging with their child's development
- Create a data-driven, personalized experience that evolves with the child

### 3.1 Key Differentiators

- **AI-Powered Personalization:** Unlike generic milestone trackers, Toddl uses AI to tailor recommendations (based on your child and the parent's medical history) about activities and toys parents can use to help their child achieve their milestones. 
- **All-in-One Solution:** Replaces the need for multiple information sources
- **Stress Reduction:** Simplified, clear guidance reduces parental overwhelm and "parent-guilt" about forgeting to track milestones or not knowing what to do to help their children
