## 1-3 MONTHS

### GROWTH - Physical

#### Length +1 inch/month

About

During the first three months of life, infants typically grow approximately one inch (2.5 cm) in length each month, representing one of the most rapid linear growth periods of childhood. According to WHO and CDC growth standards, this rapid growth reflects the anabolic (building) phase of early infancy driven by adequate nutrition, growth hormone, and thyroid hormone. Length is measured from crown (top of head) to heel with the infant lying flat. Healthcare providers plot length measurements on standardized growth charts at each well-child visit, tracking the infant's individual growth trajectory (percentile) rather than comparing to other infants. Consistent growth along a percentile curve is more important than the specific percentile achieved.

What to look for:
- Steady increase in length measurements at pediatric visits (typically at 1, 2, and 4 months)
- Visible growth evidenced by outgrowing clothing and increasing crib space needed
- Proportional growth with weight and head circumference (all tracking along similar percentiles)
- Growth plotted on WHO or CDC growth charts showing consistent trajectory
- Length increasing approximately 3 inches total during first three months
- No plateau or decline in length percentile on growth charts

Why it matters:
- Indicator of adequate nutrition, overall health, and proper endocrine function
- Deviations from expected growth pattern may signal nutritional issues, illness, or endocrine problems
- Establishes baseline growth trajectory used for ongoing monitoring throughout childhood
- Growth charts help identify both growth deficiency (failure to thrive) and excessive growth
- Premature infants use corrected age (from due date) for first two years when plotting growth
- Significant deviation from established percentile trajectory warrants medical evaluation

## 3-6 MONTHS

### TEETH - Eruption

#### Chewing

About

Around 4-6 months, babies begin making chewing motions with their gums even before teeth appear, representing emerging oral motor patterns in preparation for teething and solid food introduction. According to AAP feeding and development guidelines, this pre-chewing behavior involves rhythmic up-and-down jaw movements and lateral (side-to-side) tongue movements that differ from the sucking patterns used for feeding. Babies practice these movements on fingers, toys, clothing, and other safe objects. This oral motor development is driven by neurological maturation and often intensifies as teeth begin moving beneath the gum surface, even before eruption.

What to look for:
- Rhythmic jaw movements resembling chewing when nothing is in mouth
- Gnawing on toys, teething rings, or fingers with purposeful motion
- Bringing objects to mouth and making munching motions
- Lateral tongue movements (side to side) emerging alongside up-down jaw action
- Increased mouthing of objects compared to earlier months
- Coordination of hands bringing objects to mouth for chewing exploration

Why it matters:
- Prepares oral muscles and motor patterns for solid food consumption
- Indicates normal oral motor development and neurological maturation
- Foundation for transitional feeding skills (purees to soft solids to table foods)
- Supports sensory exploration through mouthing, a primary way infants learn about objects
- Signals readiness for introduction of solid foods alongside other developmental signs
- Provides natural gum massage that may ease teething discomfort as teeth approach surface

---

#### Sore gums

About

As primary teeth begin erupting through the gum tissue (typically starting around 4-6 months with lower central incisors), babies commonly experience gum tenderness, sensitivity, and inflammation. According to AAP and pediatric dentistry guidelines, the tooth moving through tissue causes localized pressure and tissue disruption, resulting in discomfort that varies significantly between individuals. Some babies show minimal distress while others experience notable discomfort. Gum soreness may be intermittent, increasing in the days immediately before tooth breakthrough. The inflammatory response causes increased blood flow to the area, making gums appear redder and slightly swollen where the tooth is emerging.

What to look for:
- Increased drooling, often soaking bibs or clothing
- Gum rubbing with fingers, hands, or objects
- Increased desire to chew or gnaw on toys, fingers, or other objects
- Tender, reddened, or slightly swollen gum areas where teeth are emerging
- Fussiness or irritability, especially during feeding or at night
- Brief disruptions in sleep or feeding patterns
- Bringing hands or toys repeatedly to mouth

Why it matters:
- Normal part of primary tooth eruption process experienced by most infants
- Understanding teething helps parents respond appropriately to infant distress
- Distinguishes teething discomfort from illness (teething doesn't cause fever, diarrhea, or significant illness)
- Guides appropriate comfort measures and pain management strategies
- Prompts initiation of oral hygiene practices as teeth emerge
- Severe symptoms, high fever, or persistent distress may indicate illness requiring medical evaluation

---

#### Teething symptoms: drooling

About

Increased saliva production and drooling often begins around 4-6 months as teething starts, even before the first tooth breaks through the gum surface. According to pediatric dentistry research, saliva production increases significantly during teething due to oral stimulation from tooth movement and frequent mouthing behaviors. Drooling occurs because infants haven't yet developed the oral motor coordination to consistently swallow excess saliva, particularly when focused on play or exploration. This symptom can persist throughout the teething process, which extends into toddlerhood. The excess saliva may serve protective functions, keeping the mouth clean and possibly providing some soothing effect to irritated gums.

What to look for:
- Noticeably increased saliva production compared to previous months
- Wet chin, neck, or chest requiring frequent wiping or bib changes
- Saliva pooling at corners of mouth or dripping onto clothing
- Skin irritation or rash on chin, neck, or chest from constant moisture
- Increased drooling during periods of focused play or teething discomfort
- Wet spots on clothing, bedding, or toys from mouthing objects

Why it matters:
- One of the most common and recognizable early signs of teething
- Excess saliva may help soothe irritated gums and maintain oral hygiene during eruption
- Parents can take preventive measures against skin irritation from constant moisture
- Distinguishes normal teething drooling from excessive drooling that might indicate other concerns
- Helps parents anticipate tooth emergence and prepare for oral care needs
- Persistent severe drooling beyond typical teething age or with swallowing difficulty warrants evaluation

### VISION - Development

#### Can track moving objects

About

By 3-6 months, babies develop smooth pursuit eye movements—the ability to follow moving objects steadily across their visual field without jerky movements. According to AAP and pediatric ophthalmology guidelines, this skill emerges as the extraocular muscles (muscles controlling eye movement) strengthen and the neurological pathways coordinating binocular vision mature. Early tracking at 2-3 months may be somewhat jerky or inconsistent, but by 4-6 months, babies can smoothly follow objects moving horizontally, vertically, and in circular patterns. This represents both improved eye muscle control and visual processing, as the brain must predict motion paths and coordinate both eyes to work together.

What to look for:
- Eyes follow moving toys, faces, or objects smoothly from side to side
- Tracking in multiple directions: horizontal, vertical, diagonal, and circular
- Both eyes move together in coordination (binocular tracking)
- Can follow objects across midline (past center point of visual field)
- Maintains visual attention on moving target for several seconds
- Head may turn to continue tracking object beyond eye movement range
- Smooth rather than jerky or saccadic (jumping) eye movements

Why it matters:
- Essential foundation for visual development and later reading skills
- Indicates proper development and coordination of eye muscles (extraocular muscles)
- Supports hand-eye coordination as baby learns to reach for moving objects
- Critical for spatial awareness and understanding object motion in environment
- Binocular tracking indicates eyes are working together properly, important for depth perception
- Failure to track by 4-6 months or tracking with only one eye may indicate vision problems requiring evaluation

#### Visual clarity improving

About

During months 3-6, babies' visual acuity (sharpness of vision) improves dramatically from the blurry newborn vision of approximately 20/400 to around 20/80-20/100 by 6 months. According to pediatric vision research, this improvement results from maturation of the retina (particularly the fovea where sharpest vision occurs), development of neural pathways from eye to brain, and refinement of the visual cortex processing. Contrast sensitivity also improves, allowing babies to see more subtle differences in shades and details. This clearer vision enables babies to see smaller objects, recognize faces from greater distances, and show interest in finer details of their environment.

What to look for:
- Increased interest in smaller objects and fine details on toys or faces
- Recognition of familiar faces from across a room (emerging by 5-6 months)
- Visual attention to small objects like cereal pieces or tiny toys
- Sustained looking at pictures in books with detailed images
- Notice of small changes in environment or appearance of familiar people
- Reaching accurately for objects at varying distances
- Interest in visual details like patterns, textures, or small features

Why it matters:
- Improved acuity supports all aspects of visual learning and environmental exploration
- Enables better face recognition critical for social bonding and attachment
- Allows for more sophisticated object exploration and cognitive development
- Foundation for fine motor skills as baby can see small objects to grasp
- Supports development of visual memory as details become clearer and more memorable
- Significant delays in visual clarity improvement may indicate refractive errors or other vision problems requiring evaluation

## 6-9 MONTHS

### DEVELOPMENTAL - Gross Motor Skills

#### Developing pincer grasp

About

Between 6-9 months, babies begin developing the pincer grasp—the ability to pick up small objects using thumb and index finger. According to CDC and AAP fine motor development guidelines, this sophisticated grasp emerges gradually from earlier raking (using all fingers to pull objects) and palmar grasps (holding with whole hand). Around 7-8 months, babies typically use a raking or inferior pincer grasp (thumb and side of index finger), progressing to the mature superior pincer grasp (thumb tip and index fingertip) by 9-12 months. This milestone represents significant neurological and muscular development, requiring refined motor control, opposition of the thumb, and isolation of the index finger from other fingers.

What to look for:
- Attempting to pick up small objects like cereal pieces or puffs
- Using thumb and index finger together, even if not yet at fingertips
- Progression from raking with all fingers to using just thumb and one-two fingers
- Successful pickup of progressively smaller objects
- Concentrated effort and visual attention when attempting small object pickup
- May start with scissor grasp (thumb and side of finger) before true pincer emerges
- Practice attempts even when not fully successful

Why it matters:
- Foundation for countless fine motor skills including self-feeding, drawing, writing, and manipulation
- Indicates advancing neurological development and hand-eye coordination
- Enables self-feeding with finger foods, supporting independence and oral motor development
- Reflects brain maturation allowing for isolated finger movements rather than whole-hand actions
- Critical for exploration of small objects and development of manual dexterity
- Absence or significant delay of pincer grasp by 10-12 months warrants developmental evaluation

---

#### Moves things from one hand to other

About

Around 6-9 months, babies develop the coordination to transfer objects from one hand to the other, a skill called midline transfer or hand-to-hand transfer. According to developmental motor research, this milestone requires bilateral coordination (both sides of body working together), crossing the body's midline (imaginary center line), and communication between the brain's hemispheres via the corpus callosum. This skill typically emerges around 5-7 months and becomes refined by 9 months. Transferring objects allows babies to examine items from multiple angles, free one hand for reaching while holding with the other, and demonstrates emerging understanding that both hands can work independently yet cooperatively.

What to look for:
- Deliberately passing toys from one hand to the other hand
- Crossing midline (center of body) with hands during transfer
- Examining objects by rotating them while transferring between hands
- Releasing object from one hand while simultaneously grasping with the other
- Transferring objects smoothly without dropping frequently
- Using transfer to free one hand while holding object in the other
- May transfer object then bring to mouth with either hand

Why it matters:
- Indicates normal neurological development and interhemispheric brain communication
- Foundation for bilateral coordination skills needed throughout life (using both hands together)
- Enables more sophisticated object exploration by viewing from multiple perspectives
- Supports cognitive development understanding that objects maintain properties despite manipulation
- Prerequisite for complex two-handed skills like using utensils, dressing, and writing
- Difficulty crossing midline or absence of hand-to-hand transfer by 8-9 months may indicate developmental concerns

---

#### Palmar grasp (holds objects with whole hand)

About

The palmar grasp involves holding objects using the entire hand with fingers wrapped around the item and thumb positioned on the opposite side, typically emerging around 5-7 months and used throughout 6-9 months. According to fine motor development research, this grasp is more mature than the reflexive palmar grasp of early infancy (which is involuntary) but less refined than the pincer grasp that emerges later. The voluntary palmar grasp allows babies to hold larger objects like rattles, bottles, soft books, and eventually spoons. It demonstrates voluntary motor control, adequate hand strength, and the ability to maintain grasp while manipulating objects or bringing them to the mouth for exploration.

What to look for:
- Firmly grasping larger toys, rattles, or bottles with whole hand
- Fingers curled around object with thumb opposing from other side
- Maintaining grasp while shaking, banging, or moving object
- Holding object while bringing it to mouth or transferring to other hand
- Adjusting grip strength appropriately for different objects
- Using palmar grasp on both hands with similar proficiency
- Voluntarily releasing objects (emerging skill toward end of this period)

Why it matters:
- Enables functional object manipulation for play and exploration
- Foundation for self-feeding skills including holding bottles and later using utensils
- Demonstrates transition from reflexive to voluntary motor control
- Supports cognitive development through active manipulation of environment
- Prerequisite for more refined grasps including pincer grasp
- Allows practice of hand strength and coordination needed for future fine motor tasks

#### Sits without support

About

Between 6-9 months, babies develop sufficient trunk strength, postural control, and vestibular balance to sit independently without using hands for support. According to CDC and AAP motor milestones, this typically emerges around 6 months but can occur as late as 9 months. The progression moves from tripod sitting (using hands placed forward for support) to stable independent sitting with hands free for play. This milestone requires integration of core muscles, back extensors, hip stabilizers, and developing balance reactions. Independent sitting represents a major shift in how babies interact with their environment, as both hands become available for exploration and manipulation while maintaining an upright posture.

What to look for:
- Sits steadily without hand support for extended periods (5+ minutes)
- Maintains balance while reaching for toys or turning to look around
- Can recover balance when leaning slightly to one side
- Sits with relatively straight back rather than rounded spine
- Transitions from lying to sitting with minimal assistance (emerging skill)
- Uses hands freely for play rather than propping for balance
- Shows symmetric posture without consistent leaning to one side

Why it matters:
- Frees both hands for two-handed object manipulation and exploration
- Improves respiratory function and digestion compared to lying positions
- Provides stable base for developing fine motor skills like transferring objects
- Allows better visual survey of environment, supporting cognitive development
- Foundation for more advanced motor skills like crawling and standing
- Persistent difficulty sitting by 9 months may indicate developmental delay requiring evaluation

#### Uses fingers to rake food toward self

About

Around 6-9 months, babies use a raking motion with all fingers extended to pull food pieces toward themselves and into their palm, representing an early self-feeding skill before pincer grasp develops. According to AAP feeding guidelines, this raking or scooping motion emerges as babies develop hand-eye coordination and understand they can use their hands to obtain desired objects. The rake grasp involves extending fingers, placing them behind or around food items, then pulling toward the palm in a sweeping motion. This is typically the first grasping pattern used for self-feeding and indicates readiness for finger foods alongside other developmental signs.

What to look for:
- Using extended fingers to pull food pieces toward palm or body
- Scooping motion with all fingers working together
- Successfully raking multiple small pieces or one larger piece
- Bringing raked food to mouth (even if messily or inefficiently)
- Increasing accuracy with practice over several weeks
- Using rake grasp with both hands during meals
- Persistent attempts to self-feed even when challenging

Why it matters:
- First self-feeding skill indicating readiness for finger foods
- Develops hand-eye coordination in functional, meaningful context
- Supports independence and participation in family mealtimes
- Provides sensory experience with different food textures
- Foundation for more refined pincer grasp used for picking up small foods
- Encourages oral motor development through varied textures and self-paced eating

### HEARING - Development

#### 7M: Babbles

About

Around 7 months, babies enter the canonical babbling stage, producing repetitive consonant-vowel combinations like "bababa," "dadada," or "mamama." According to ASHA language development guidelines, this represents a critical transition from earlier cooing and vocal play to speech-like sounds. Canonical babbling requires sophisticated motor control of lips, tongue, jaw, and vocal cords working in coordination with breathing. Babies practice the phonemes (sound units) of their native language, with babbling patterns beginning to reflect the intonation and rhythm of the language they hear. This stage is universal across languages but timing can vary. Babbling serves as vocal practice essential for later word production.

What to look for:
- Repetitive consonant-vowel syllables like "baba," "dada," "gaga," "mama"
- Syllables produced in strings or sequences rather than single sounds
- Variety of consonant sounds including b, d, g, m, n
- Babbling that sounds increasingly speech-like with intonation patterns
- Babbling during play, when content, and during social interaction
- Appears to be "practicing" sounds, repeating syllables multiple times
- May make eye contact or direct babbling toward people as if conversing

Why it matters:
- Critical stage in speech development representing motor practice for talking
- Indicates normal hearing, oral motor development, and neurological maturation
- Provides foundation for phonological development and first words
- Supports language learning through auditory feedback (hearing own sounds)
- Facilitates social interaction and turn-taking in "conversations"
- Absence of babbling by 9 months is a red flag requiring hearing evaluation and developmental screening

---

#### 7M: Tries to communicate with gestures

About

Around 7 months, babies start using intentional gestures like reaching with open hands, looking between objects and people, pushing away unwanted items, and leaning toward desired objects or people to communicate wants and needs. According to language development research, gestural communication emerges before spoken language and represents babies' understanding that they can intentionally influence others' behavior. These early gestures are proto-imperatives (requesting) and proto-declaratives (sharing attention), forming the foundation of pragmatic communication. Babies may combine gestures with vocalizations and use eye contact to ensure caregivers are attending to their communication attempts.

What to look for:
- Reaching with open hands toward desired objects or people
- Looking back and forth between object/person and caregiver (referential looking)
- Leaning body toward desired items or directions
- Pushing away unwanted objects, food, or toys
- Raising arms to be picked up (emerging around 8-9 months)
- Gesturing more persistently if not initially understood
- Using eye contact to check if caregiver is watching gesture

Why it matters:
- First form of intentional communication beyond crying
- Indicates understanding that communication is reciprocal and intentional
- Foundation for later development of pointing, signing, and verbal language
- Shows social cognition including joint attention and understanding others' attention
- Enables babies to participate more actively in interactions and express preferences
- Delays in intentional gesture use may indicate communication or social development concerns

---

#### Imitates familiar sounds

About

Between 6-9 months, babies begin imitating sounds they hear regularly, including speech sounds, animal noises, environmental sounds like coughs or tongue clicks, and vocal patterns like intonation. According to ASHA speech-language milestones, this vocal imitation demonstrates auditory memory (remembering sounds heard), auditory discrimination (distinguishing different sounds), and developing motor control to reproduce sounds. Early imitations may be approximations rather than perfect matches, but the intentional attempt to copy demonstrates important cognitive-linguistic development. Babies are most likely to imitate sounds that interest them or occur in predictable, playful contexts.

What to look for:
- Attempting to copy simple syllables or sounds made by caregivers
- Imitating familiar sounds like coughs, raspberries, tongue clicks
- Copying vocal patterns or intonation even if not exact sounds
- More successful imitation of frequently heard sounds
- Showing pleasure or excitement when successfully imitating
- Waiting for and expecting caregivers to respond with the same sound
- Progressively better approximations of target sounds with practice

Why it matters:
- Critical mechanism for language learning across all languages
- Indicates integrated development of hearing, memory, and motor systems
- Foundation for learning first words through auditory-motor mapping
- Supports turn-taking and social interaction patterns important for communication
- Demonstrates motivation to communicate and engage socially
- Provides practice with phonemes needed for later speech production

---

#### Produces non-repetitive syllables

About

Around 6-9 months, babies progress from repetitive canonical babbling ("bababa") to variegated babbling—combining different syllables like "bada," "maba," or "diga." According to speech-language development research, variegated babbling more closely resembles real speech prosody and syllable diversity. This requires more sophisticated motor planning as the baby must transition between different consonants and vowels rather than repeating the same combination. The emergence of variegated babbling indicates advancing neurological maturation and oral motor control. These sound combinations often sound like sentences in an unknown language, complete with adult-like intonation and rhythm.

What to look for:
- Syllable strings with changing consonants or vowels (not just "bababa")
- Combinations like "bada," "duba," "madi," "giba"
- Babbling that sounds increasingly like conversational speech
- Varied intonation patterns across different syllable strings
- Longer strings of varied syllables (3-5+ syllables)
- May sound like baby is "talking" in sentences but without real words
- Continued alongside some repetitive babbling (both types coexist)

Why it matters:
- Represents advancing motor planning and vocal coordination beyond repetitive patterns
- More closely approximates real speech patterns in terms of diversity and prosody
- Bridge between simple babbling and emergence of first meaningful words
- Indicates typical progression in pre-linguistic vocal development
- Provides practice with phoneme combinations needed for actual word production
- Lack of progression to variegated babbling by 10-12 months may warrant speech-language evaluation

---

#### Tries to repeat sounds

About

Between 6-9 months, babies actively attempt to repeat sounds they hear, especially from parents and caregivers, showing intentional effort even when reproductions are imperfect. According to language acquisition research, this represents the beginning of vocal imitation—a critical mechanism for language learning. Babies demonstrate auditory memory by attempting sounds seconds or even minutes after hearing them, showing they've encoded the acoustic pattern. Motor attempts to match heard sounds indicate developing awareness of their own vocal production and the connection between auditory input and motor output. Babies show particular interest in repeating sounds that elicit positive responses from caregivers.

What to look for:
- Clear attempts to copy sounds made by caregivers, even if inaccurate
- Concentration or focused attention when trying to produce specific sounds
- Repetition attempts increasing in accuracy with multiple tries
- Pleasure or satisfaction when successfully approximating target sound
- Waiting after caregiver's sound production, as if considering how to respond
- More frequent attempts with familiar, frequently heard sounds
- May attempt repetition immediately or after brief delay

Why it matters:
- Foundational skill for all later word learning and language acquisition
- Indicates auditory-motor mapping developing in brain
- Demonstrates intentional communication rather than random vocalization
- Supports phonological development by practicing speech sound production
- Strengthens caregiver-infant interaction through reciprocal vocal play
- Significant difficulty with sound imitation by 9-12 months may indicate hearing or motor speech concerns

### VISION - Development

#### Depth perception well-developed

About

By 6-9 months, babies develop sophisticated depth perception—the ability to judge distances and see the world in three dimensions. According to developmental vision research, depth perception requires binocular vision (both eyes working together) to create slightly different images that the brain integrates into 3D perception. While stereopsis (fine depth perception) begins around 4-6 months, it becomes well-developed by 8-9 months. This coincides with increased mobility as crawling begins, making accurate depth perception functionally important for safe navigation. Depth perception depends on visual cues including binocular disparity, motion parallax, and monocular cues like relative size and overlap.

What to look for:
- Reaching accurately for objects at varying distances
- Showing caution at edges like bed edges or stairs (visual cliff response)
- Adjusting hand pre-shaping when reaching based on object distance
- Successfully navigating around obstacles when crawling
- Coordinating movements in three-dimensional space
- Visually tracking objects moving toward and away, not just side-to-side
- Showing interest in dropping objects and watching them fall (distance judgment)

Why it matters:
- Essential for safe mobility including crawling, cruising, and later walking
- Enables accurate reaching and grasping, supporting fine motor development
- Critical for spatial awareness and understanding environmental layout
- Foundation for more complex motor skills requiring distance judgment
- Supports cognitive development of spatial relationships and object properties
- Problems with depth perception may indicate vision issues requiring evaluation

---

#### Grasps object permanence

About

Object permanence—the understanding that objects continue to exist even when they cannot be seen—typically develops between 6-9 months according to Piaget's cognitive development theory and contemporary infant cognition research. Initially around 6 months, babies will search for partially hidden objects, progressing to searching for completely hidden objects by 8-9 months. This cognitive milestone requires visual memory, understanding of occlusion (objects can be behind other things), and the concept that objects are permanent entities. Development of object permanence often triggers separation anxiety as babies now understand caregivers exist elsewhere when out of sight.

What to look for:
- Searching for toys hidden under blankets or behind barriers
- Looking toward the floor when dropping objects
- Pulling away blankets or moving obstacles to retrieve hidden toys
- Continuing to look for objects that have rolled out of view
- Showing surprise or concern when expected objects are not where anticipated
- Beginning of separation distress when caregiver leaves room
- Enjoying peek-a-boo games with understanding of the game's concept

Why it matters:
- Represents major cognitive leap in understanding object properties and constancy
- Foundation for symbolic thinking and mental representation
- Explains emergence of separation anxiety (positive developmental sign)
- Enables purposeful searching behaviors and problem-solving
- Supports memory development and spatial understanding
- Significantly delayed object permanence may indicate cognitive developmental concerns

---

#### Vision sharpens

About

Between 6-9 months, visual acuity continues improving significantly, reaching approximately 20/60 to 20/40 by 9 months according to pediatric ophthalmology research. This sharpening results from ongoing retinal maturation, particularly the fovea (central retina responsible for sharp detailed vision), continued myelination of the optic nerve, and refinement of visual cortex processing. Contrast sensitivity also improves, allowing babies to detect more subtle differences in patterns, shading, and details. This enhanced visual acuity supports increasing interest in small objects, detailed exploration, and recognition of familiar people at greater distances. By 9 months, babies can see fine details that were previously too small to detect.

What to look for:
- Noticing and attending to small objects like crumbs or small toys
- Recognizing familiar people across rooms or at distances
- Interest in fine details like small pictures in books or patterns on fabric
- Accurate reaching for small objects indicating they're clearly seen
- Visual attention to small features on faces (freckles, jewelry)
- Differentiating similar objects based on small visual differences
- Sustained visual inspection of detailed or complex images

Why it matters:
- Supports all aspects of visual learning and environmental exploration
- Enables fine motor skill development as baby can see small objects clearly to manipulate
- Critical for social development through clear facial recognition and expression reading
- Allows for more sophisticated object categorization and recognition
- Foundation for later visual skills including reading
- Significantly blurry vision at this age may indicate refractive errors or other vision problems requiring correction

## 9-12 MONTHS

### DEVELOPMENTAL - Gross Motor Skills

#### Drinks from cup without lid

About

Around 9-12 months, babies begin learning to drink from an open cup without a lid or sippy spout, requiring coordination of hand grip, wrist tilting, lip closure, swallowing, and breathing. According to AAP feeding recommendations and speech-language pathology guidelines, open cup drinking promotes better oral motor development, more mature swallow patterns, and healthier dental development compared to prolonged bottle or sippy cup use. Initially, parents hold and tip the cup while baby practices lip seal and swallowing, progressing to baby controlling cup with assistance, and eventually independent open cup use (typically 12-18+ months for true independence). Spills are expected and normal during this learning process.

What to look for:
- Attempts to bring small cup to mouth with one or both hands
- Lip closure around cup rim rather than tongue protrusion
- Small sips rather than large gulps
- Coordinated swallowing without excessive choking or coughing
- Attempting to tilt cup appropriately (though may over-tilt initially)
- Interest in practicing with cups during meals
- Gradually decreasing spills with repeated practice over weeks/months

Why it matters:
- Promotes optimal oral motor development for speech and feeding
- Supports mature swallowing patterns and reduces tongue thrust
- Better for dental health than prolonged sippy cup or bottle use
- Encourages self-regulation of liquid intake
- Foundation for independent drinking skills
- Recommended by AAP to begin by 12 months to support developmental progression away from bottle

#### Pincer grasp (picks things up with thumb and pointer finger)

About

The mature pincer grasp emerges around 9-12 months, characterized by picking up small objects using the tips of the thumb and index finger in opposition. According to fine motor development research, this represents the culmination of grasp development from reflexive grasping to raking to inferior pincer (thumb and side of finger) to this refined superior pincer grasp. This skill requires sophisticated neurological control including thumb opposition, index finger isolation from other fingers, precise motor control, and hand-eye coordination. The pincer grasp is a hallmark 9-month milestone and enables manipulation of very small objects including finger foods, small toys, and eventually crayons and writing implements.

What to look for:
- Using just thumb tip and index fingertip to pick up small items
- Fingers precisely positioned rather than using whole hand
- Successfully picking up tiny objects like cereal pieces, puffs, or small toys
- Controlled grasp rather than crushing delicate items
- Using pincer grasp with both hands with similar proficiency
- Able to release small objects precisely (putting items in containers)
- Preference emerging for using pincer over earlier raking or palmar grasps

Why it matters:
- Represents significant fine motor milestone indicating neurological maturity
- Essential for self-feeding with finger foods, supporting nutrition and independence
- Foundation for countless future fine motor tasks including drawing, writing, buttoning
- Indicates successful progression through grasp development stages
- Enables exploration of small objects and development of manual dexterity
- Significant delay or absence of pincer grasp by 12 months warrants occupational therapy evaluation

#### Points with index finger

About

Around 9-12 months, babies begin pointing with their index finger extended while other fingers are flexed, representing a major communication and cognitive milestone. According to research on joint attention and early communication, pointing serves multiple functions: proto-imperative pointing (requesting objects), proto-declarative pointing (sharing interest or commenting), and follows pointing (following others' points). Pointing requires motor isolation of the index finger, understanding that pointing directs others' attention, and awareness that attention can be shared. This gesture typically emerges around 9-11 months and is considered a crucial social-communication skill and predictor of later language development.

What to look for:
- Extending index finger while other fingers remain flexed
- Pointing at interesting objects, people, or events
- Looking between pointed object and caregiver (checking for shared attention)
- Pointing to request desired items
- Responding to others' points by looking at indicated object
- Pointing to pictures in books
- Increasing frequency and variety of pointing as skill develops

Why it matters:
- Critical early communication skill bridging pre-verbal and verbal communication
- Indicates understanding of joint attention (sharing focus on same thing)
- Strong predictor of later language development and vocabulary growth
- Demonstrates social cognition and understanding of others' attention
- Foundation for more sophisticated communication including showing, giving, gestural routines
- Absence of pointing by 12-15 months is a red flag warranting developmental screening, particularly for autism

#### Releases objects voluntarily

About

Around 9-12 months, babies develop the ability to intentionally release objects from their grasp rather than only dropping reflexively or accidentally. According to fine motor development research, voluntary release requires active muscle relaxation and motor control, which develops later than grasping. This skill enables placing objects in containers, giving items to others, setting objects down gently, and releasing to take a new object. Controlled release involves graded extension of fingers, timing, and often visual monitoring. This milestone represents an important advance in hand function, transitioning from primarily grasping to both grasping and releasing for functional purposes.

What to look for:
- Deliberately dropping or placing objects rather than accidental release
- Placing objects into containers with apparent intention
- Giving toys to others when requested or spontaneously
- Setting objects down rather than throwing everything
- Timing release appropriately (not too early or late when giving to others)
- Opening hands to release rather than needing caregiver to extract object
- Playing with drop-and-retrieve games repeatedly and purposefully

Why it matters:
- Essential component of functional hand use for countless daily tasks
- Enables participation in shape sorters, stacking, and constructive play
- Supports social interaction through giving and receiving objects
- Foundation for more refined object placement and manipulation
- Indicates motor planning and control progressing beyond just grasping
- Difficulty with voluntary release may indicate motor control issues requiring evaluation

### HEARING - Development

#### Answers questions nonverbally

About

Between 9-12 months, babies can respond to simple questions using gestures, actions, or facial expressions rather than words, demonstrating receptive language comprehension developing ahead of expressive language. According to language development guidelines, babies at this stage understand far more than they can verbalize. Nonverbal responses include head shaking (often side-to-side for "no" around 10-12 months), pointing to answer "where" questions, performing actions in response (clapping for "are you happy?"), or using facial expressions. These responses indicate babies are processing language, understanding question structure, and intentionally communicating answers through available means.

What to look for:
- Shaking or nodding head in response to yes/no questions (head shake for "no" typically emerges first)
- Pointing to objects or people when asked "where is...?"
- Performing actions in response to questions (waving when asked "can you wave?")
- Facial expressions communicating answers (smiling for yes, frowning for no)
- Looking toward or moving toward correct answer to questions
- Consistent responses indicating true comprehension, not random actions
- Waiting briefly after question, showing processing before responding

Why it matters:
- Demonstrates receptive language significantly ahead of expressive language abilities
- Shows comprehension of question structure and intentional communication
- Indicates baby understands symbolic communication and response expectations
- Foundation for verbal answering that emerges later in second year
- Supports assessment of language comprehension when expressive language is limited
- Lack of nonverbal responses to familiar questions by 12-15 months may indicate language delay

#### Follows simple directions with gestures

About

Around 9-12 months, babies can follow simple one-step directions when accompanied by supportive gestures, demonstrating receptive language development and the ability to connect words with actions. According to ASHA language milestones, early direction-following relies heavily on contextual cues and gestures (like "come here" with arms extended or "give it to me" with extended hand). The baby attends to both the verbal instruction and the gestural support, gradually learning the word-action connection. Common early directions include "come here," "give it to me," "wave bye-bye," and "where's [familiar object]?" Consistent routines and gestures help babies learn these connections.

What to look for:
- Responding appropriately to familiar requests with gesture support ("come here" with arms out)
- Following directions more reliably when gestures accompany words
- May not respond without gestural cues at this stage
- Consistent response to frequently used directions
- Processing pause between hearing direction and responding
- Success with 3-5 familiar routines/directions
- Beginning to respond to familiar requests without gestures (emerging skill)

Why it matters:
- Indicates receptive language developing and word-action associations forming
- Shows baby attending to communication and understanding intentional requests
- Foundation for following verbal-only directions in coming months
- Supports compliance and cooperation in daily routines
- Demonstrates cognitive ability to remember and execute simple instructions
- Significant difficulty following simple gestural directions may warrant language or hearing evaluation

---

#### Follows simple one-step commands

About

Between 9-12 months, babies are developing the ability to follow simple verbal directions, though most at this age still rely on gestural cues and context. True verbal-only command-following typically emerges more reliably around 12-15 months. According to language development research, early commands babies understand include familiar routines like "give me [object]," "come here," "wave bye-bye," "clap hands," and "show me [object]." Context and routine help significantly—babies follow familiar requests in familiar settings more easily. This skill demonstrates receptive language vocabulary including object names, action words, and understanding of communicative intent.

What to look for:
- Responding to familiar verbal requests even without gestures (emerging around 12 months)
- Following directions for 3-5 familiar actions or objects
- Success particularly with routine requests ("get your shoes," "find your bottle")
- May still need contextual cues or gestures for less familiar commands
- Processing time between hearing command and responding
- More reliable compliance with practice and repetition
- Beginning to generalize commands across different contexts

Why it matters:
- Demonstrates receptive language significantly ahead of expressive language
- Indicates vocabulary comprehension and understanding of action words
- Supports daily routines and caregiver-child communication
- Foundation for following more complex multi-step directions later
- Shows cognitive ability to process language, remember instruction, and execute action
- Difficulty following simple familiar commands by 12-15 months may indicate hearing or language concerns

### VISION - Development

#### 12M: Recognizes people from distance

About

By 12 months, babies can visually recognize familiar people—parents, siblings, regular caregivers—from across a room or outdoor distance of 20-30+ feet. According to visual development research, this ability reflects visual acuity approaching 20/40 to 20/50 combined with strong visual memory for familiar faces. Babies at this age show recognition through social responses like smiling, waving, vocalizing, or moving toward the person. This demonstrates both the visual system's maturity to resolve facial features at distance and cognitive development of person permanence and relationship awareness. Distance recognition provides social security and supports attachment.

What to look for:
- Smiling, waving, or vocalizing when familiar person enters room from distance
- Differential response to familiar vs. unfamiliar people at distance
- Seeking out specific family members across rooms or outdoor spaces
- Showing excitement or recognition before person is close enough for detailed features
- Navigating toward recognized person from across spaces
- Recognition based on overall appearance including body shape, hair, characteristic features
- Consistent recognition across different distances and lighting conditions

Why it matters:
- Indicates visual acuity sufficient for distance face recognition
- Demonstrates strong visual memory and person recognition abilities
- Supports secure attachment and social bonding

- Lack of distance recognition by 12-15 months may indicate vision or social-cognitive concerns

---

#### 12M: Sees across room

About

By 12 months, babies have developed visual acuity approaching 20/40, allowing them to clearly see objects, people, and activities across typical room distances of 10-20 feet. According to pediatric ophthalmology research, this represents significant maturation from newborn vision of 20/400 and even 6-month vision of approximately 20/80. Seeing across rooms enables babies to survey their environment, notice events and people at distance, navigate toward distant goals, and maintain visual contact with caregivers across spaces. This distance vision supports increasing mobility and independence as babies become more capable of moving away from caregivers while maintaining visual connection.

What to look for:
- Noticing and responding to events happening across room
- Pointing to or naming objects at room distance
- Visually following people or pets moving across spaces
- Navigating toward toys or people seen from across room
- Watching activities like television or siblings playing from distance
- Looking to caregiver across room for social referencing
- Showing interest in detailed objects or pictures at moderate distances

Why it matters:
- Supports safe navigation as mobility increases with crawling and walking
- Enables baby to survey environment and make movement decisions
- Critical for maintaining connection with caregivers during exploration
- Allows participation in activities and observation of family life from varying distances
- Foundation for later distance skills including catching balls and reading boards
- Poor distance vision may indicate refractive errors requiring correction

---

#### Eye-hand coordination well-developed

About

By 9-12 months, babies have developed sophisticated eye-hand coordination—the ability to use visual information to guide precise hand movements. According to developmental research, eye-hand coordination requires integration of visual input processed by the occipital lobe with motor planning from the frontal cortex and motor execution from the motor cortex and cerebellum. Well-developed coordination at this age is demonstrated through accurate reaching, precise pincer grasp pickup, placing objects in containers, stacking, and early self-feeding. This skill represents maturation of visual-motor pathways, depth perception, motor planning, and fine motor control working together.

What to look for:
- Accurately reaching for and grasping objects at various distances
- Precise pickup of very small objects using pincer grasp
- Successfully placing objects into containers or onto surfaces
- Stacking 2-3 objects with accuracy
- Self-feeding with fingers, bringing food accurately to mouth

- Manipulating toys with precision (pushing buttons, turning pages)

Why it matters:
- Foundation for countless functional skills throughout life
- Essential for self-feeding, playing, and exploring environment
- Indicates successful integration of visual and motor systems
- Prerequisite for more complex skills like drawing, writing, sports
- Supports cognitive development through accurate environmental manipulation
- Poor eye-hand coordination may indicate vision, motor, or integration difficulties requiring evaluation

---

#### Judges distances well

About

By 9-12 months, babies can accurately estimate distances to objects and people, allowing for precise reaching, confident crawling or cruising, and appropriate motor planning for movement. According to visual development and motor research, distance judgment combines depth perception (stereopsis), visual acuity, proprioception (body position awareness), and experience with movement outcomes. Babies adjust reaching distance, crawling speed, and hand pre-shaping based on visual distance information. This skill becomes particularly important as mobility increases, helping babies navigate safely around furniture, stairs, and obstacles while moving toward goals.

What to look for:
- Reaching with appropriate arm extension for object distance
- Pre-shaping hand to match object size and distance during reaching
- Confident crawling or cruising toward targets without frequent miscalculations
- Appropriate caution at edges or drop-offs (visual cliff awareness)
- Adjusting movement speed when navigating toward obstacles
- Successfully navigating around furniture at appropriate distances
- Accurate throwing or dropping based on distance to target

Why it matters:
- Critical for safe mobility including crawling, cruising, and early walking
- Enables precise reaching and object manipulation
- Supports spatial reasoning and navigation skills
- Foundation for more complex motor planning with distance components
- Important safety skill helping avoid falls and collisions
- Poor distance judgment may indicate vision problems particularly with depth perception

---

#### Throws with precision

About

Around 9-12 months, babies begin throwing objects with some intentional aim and precision rather than random releasing. According to motor development research, early throwing combines visual targeting, distance judgment, motor planning, and coordinated arm movement. Initial throws may be downward toward floors or containers, progressing to forward throws toward people or targets. Precision is relative at this age—babies show clear intent to direct throws even if accuracy is inconsistent. Throwing requires integration of visual-spatial processing, motor planning, and developing understanding of object trajectories. This is exploration and skill-building, not misbehavior.

What to look for:
- Throwing with apparent aim toward specific targets (people, containers, spaces)
- Adjusting throw force for different distances (emerging skill)
- Visual attention to target before and during throw
- Varying throw direction intentionally (not just forward)
- Pleasure or interest in where thrown objects land
- Practicing throwing repeatedly with apparent goal
- Combining throwing with retrieval in games

Why it matters:
- Demonstrates developing eye-hand coordination and motor planning
- Foundation for ball skills and sports participation later
- Shows understanding of cause-effect and object trajectories
- Supports spatial reasoning and distance estimation
- Normal exploratory behavior testing object properties and motor capabilities
- Provides opportunity to teach appropriate throwing contexts and objects

## 12-18 MONTHS

### HEARING - Development

#### Follows simple one-step commands

About

Between 12-18 months, toddlers develop reliable ability to follow simple verbal directions without needing accompanying gestures, though context and familiar routines still provide helpful support. According to ASHA language milestones, one-step commands at this age include familiar requests like "get your shoes," "give me the ball," "come here," "sit down," and "close the door." This demonstrates receptive vocabulary growing significantly, comprehension of action words (verbs), and ability to process verbal instruction, maintain it briefly in working memory, and execute the requested action. Success is greatest with familiar objects, routines, and environments, with generalization to novel contexts developing gradually.

What to look for:
- Following 5-10+ different simple commands without gestural support
- Success with novel objects when asked (not just highly familiar routines)
- Responding after brief processing time (few seconds delay normal)
- Following commands across different contexts and from different speakers
- Generalization from familiar to less familiar requests
- May need occasional repetition but shows clear comprehension
- Following commands even when engaged in other activities

Why it matters:
- Indicates receptive language vocabulary expanding significantly (50-100+ words understood)
- Demonstrates ability to process verbal instruction and execute action sequences
- Supports cooperation, safety, and participation in daily routines
- Shows cognitive ability to understand increasingly abstract verbal concepts
- Foundation for following multi-step directions in coming months
- Significant difficulty with simple commands by 18 months warrants language evaluation

---

#### Understanding exceeds speaking ability

About

Throughout 12-18 months and beyond, toddlers' receptive language (what they understand) significantly exceeds expressive language (what they can say). According to language acquisition research, this gap is typical and expected—receptive vocabulary may include 50-150+ words while expressive vocabulary ranges from 5-50 words during this period. Toddlers demonstrate understanding through following directions, pointing to named objects, appropriate responses to questions, and nonverbal communication. Understanding includes object names, people's names, action words, body parts, and familiar routines. This receptive-expressive gap narrows somewhat over time but receptive language continues to lead.

What to look for:
- Responding appropriately to many more words than child can say
- Following increasingly complex directions despite limited speech
- Pointing to many objects when named even if can't name them
- Understanding questions and requests about unseen objects or future events
- Demonstrating knowledge through actions rather than words
- Showing comprehension of concepts like "big/small," "in/out," "more/all done"
- Growing receptive vocabulary evident through expanding appropriate responses

Why it matters:
- Normal pattern of language development—comprehension develops first
- Indicates language processing and learning occurring even when expressive language is limited
- Guides parents to talk richly despite child's limited verbal responses
- Helps identify true language delays vs. normal expressive delays when receptive is strong
- Shows cognitive and linguistic development on track despite limited talking
- Supports patience with expressive language emergence knowing comprehension is strong

---

#### Vocabulary expanding rapidly

About

Between 12-18 months, toddlers' receptive vocabulary (words understood) grows rapidly from approximately 50 words at 12 months to 150-200+ words by 18 months according to language development research. This rapid growth is driven by increasing cognitive abilities including categorization, symbolic thinking, and explicit teaching/labeling by caregivers. Vocabulary includes expanding categories: more object names, people's names, action words (verbs), descriptors (big, hot), body parts, and routine words (more, all done). This receptive vocabulary growth provides the foundation for the "word explosion" in expressive language that typically occurs around 18-24 months. Words are learned through repeated exposure in meaningful contexts.

What to look for:
- Noticeably increasing number of words child responds to or comprehends
- Pointing to many objects, pictures, or people when named
- Following increasingly varied directions indicating word knowledge
- Showing understanding of action words (verbs) like "eat," "throw," "give"
- Responding to descriptive words like "hot," "big," "wet"
- Understanding words across different contexts (generalizing word meanings)
- Learning new words relatively quickly after several exposures (fast mapping emerging)

Why it matters:
- Indicates healthy language development and learning capacity
- Provides foundation for upcoming expressive vocabulary explosion
- Supports cognitive development through expanding conceptual knowledge
- Enables more sophisticated communication and participation in routines
- Strong predictor of later language and literacy skills
- Slow vocabulary growth (fewer than 50 words understood by 18 months) may warrant evaluation

### TEETH - Eruption

#### 13M: First molars erupt

About

Around 13 months (typically between 12-16 months), the first primary molars begin erupting, usually starting with lower first molars followed by upper first molars. According to pediatric dentistry guidelines, these are typically the fifth and sixth teeth to appear (after central and lateral incisors) and are large, flat teeth designed for chewing and grinding food. First molars often cause more discomfort than incisors due to their larger size and broader eruption surface. Once erupted, these molars significantly increase the child's ability to chew varied textures. Eruption timing varies widely—up to six months earlier or later than average is still considered within normal range.

What to look for:
- Increased fussiness, drooling, or chewing behavior around 12-16 months
- Visible swelling or redness on gums toward back of mouth
- Disrupted sleep or eating patterns during eruption
- White spots appearing on back gums as teeth break through
- Child chewing preferentially on back gums or avoiding certain foods
- Relief from chewing on teething toys or cold foods
- Four molars total (one in each quadrant) erupting over several weeks/months

Why it matters:
- Significantly expands chewing ability and food texture tolerance
- Normal developmental progression in primary tooth eruption sequence
- May cause more pronounced discomfort than earlier teeth due to size
- Indicates appropriate dental development and jaw growth
- Molars are critical for proper chewing and nutrition
- Early dental visit recommended by age 1 to establish oral health care and assess development

---

#### 16M: Canines continue

About

Around 16 months (typically between 16-20 months), the canine teeth (pointed teeth between incisors and molars) erupt, usually starting with upper canines followed by lower canines. According to dental development norms, canines typically emerge after first molars despite being positioned between front teeth and molars. These pointed teeth are designed for tearing food and complete more of the chewing surface area. Canine eruption occurs during an age when toddlers are expanding their diet significantly, making these functional teeth important for handling meats, fruits, and other foods requiring tearing. Four canines total (one in each quadrant) will erupt, often over several weeks or months.

What to look for:
- Pointed teeth emerging on sides of smile between incisors and molars
- Four canines (one per quadrant) erupting during 16-20+ month period
- Possible increased teething symptoms: drooling, chewing, fussiness
- May prefer softer foods temporarily during active eruption
- Visible gum swelling where teeth are emerging
- Complete eruption of canines may take several weeks per tooth
- Expanding ability to handle different food textures

Why it matters:
- Completes more of primary dentition for functional chewing
- Normal part of tooth eruption sequence
- Enables better handling of varied food textures requiring tearing
- Indicates appropriate dental and jaw development
- With first molars and canines, toddler has most teeth needed for varied diet
- Regular dental visits monitor eruption and oral health

### VISION - Development

#### Recognizes/points to pictures in books

About

Between 12-18 months, toddlers develop the ability to recognize familiar objects, animals, and people in pictures and point to them when asked ("where's the dog?") or spontaneously. According to cognitive and visual development research, picture recognition requires understanding that two-dimensional images represent three-dimensional objects—an early form of symbolic thinking. Toddlers at this stage recognize realistic photographs and clear illustrations more easily than abstract or stylized images. This skill integrates visual perception, visual memory, categorization, receptive language, and the motor skill of pointing. Picture recognition is foundational for literacy, as reading requires understanding that symbols represent meaning.

What to look for:
- Pointing to familiar objects in books when asked "where is [object]?"
- Spontaneously pointing to and labeling (or vocalizing about) pictures
- Recognizing same object across different illustrations or photographs
- Showing interest in picture books and sustained attention to images
- Making connections between pictures and real objects (e.g., pointing to dog in book then real dog)
- Turning pages to find particular pictures
- Expanding number of images recognized from few to many over this period

Why it matters:
- Demonstrates symbolic thinking—understanding representations of reality
- Foundation for literacy as reading requires interpreting visual symbols
- Supports vocabulary development through picture-word associations
- Indicates visual perception, memory, and categorization developing appropriately
- Encourages book engagement and early literacy experiences
- Strengthens caregiver-child interaction during shared book reading

#### Vision approaching adult clarity

About

By 12-18 months, toddlers' visual acuity approaches adult levels, typically 20/40 to 20/30, with continued refinement toward 20/20 occurring through early childhood. According to pediatric ophthalmology research, this represents substantial maturation of the retina, particularly the fovea (central retina), complete myelination of the optic nerve, and sophisticated visual cortex processing. While some fine-tuning continues until age 5-6, vision at 12-18 months is functionally mature for most daily activities. Toddlers can see fine details, discriminate small differences, recognize faces and objects clearly at distance, and process complex visual scenes. This visual clarity supports learning, mobility, and social interaction.

What to look for:
- Noticing small objects, details, or features easily
- Recognizing familiar people at significant distances
- Interest in detailed pictures, small parts of toys, or tiny objects
- Accurate reaching and manipulation of small objects
- No apparent squinting, head tilting, or eye strain during visual activities
- Successful visual discrimination between similar objects or pictures
- Age-appropriate participation in visual activities (puzzles, picture books)

Why it matters:
- Mature vision supports all areas of learning and development
- Enables fine motor skill development through clear visual guidance
- Critical for social interaction through facial recognition and expression reading
- Supports spatial navigation and safety in environment
- Foundation for later detailed visual tasks including reading and writing
- Persistent vision problems at this age require evaluation and possible correction for optimal development

---

#### Visual memory developing

About

Visual memory—the ability to remember and recall visual information—develops significantly during 12-18 months as the hippocampus and visual cortex mature. According to developmental cognitive research, toddlers at this stage can remember people, objects, places, and events seen hours or days earlier and demonstrate this memory through recognition behaviors, search behaviors, and emerging ability to recall absent objects or people. Visual memory extends beyond simple object permanence to include spatial memory (remembering locations), sequential memory (remembering order), and associative memory (linking visual information with other sensory or emotional experiences). This supports navigation, learning, and social relationships.

What to look for:
- Recognizing places visited previously (even after weeks)
- Remembering where objects are typically stored and searching there
- Showing recognition of people not seen recently
- Recalling and searching for hidden objects in correct locations
- Remembering associations (coat means going outside, high chair means eating)
- Visual attention to pictures of familiar people or places
- Demonstrating memory through play (recreating observed activities)

Why it matters:
- Foundation for learning across all domains
- Supports navigation and spatial understanding of environments
- Critical for social relationships through person recognition and recall
- Enables learning from past experiences and applying to new situations
- Foundation for more complex memory including autobiographical memory
- Supports language development as words link to remembered visual referents
- Significant memory concerns warrant developmental evaluation

## 24-36 MONTHS

### DEVELOPMENTAL - Gross Motor Skills

#### Climbs

About

Between 2-3 years, toddlers develop confident climbing skills on furniture, playground equipment, and stairs, demonstrating advancing strength, coordination, motor planning, and spatial awareness. According to gross motor development research, climbing at this age involves coordinating arm and leg movements, shifting weight appropriately, maintaining balance while transitioning body position, and planning movement sequences to reach goals. Toddlers climb on couches, chairs, beds, playground structures, and stairs with increasing confidence and decreasing need for assistance. Climbing represents a natural developmental drive to explore vertically and test physical capabilities. Safety judgment lags significantly behind climbing ability.

What to look for:
- Climbing onto furniture independently (couches, chairs, low tables)
- Navigating playground climbing structures with supervision
- Climbing stairs confidently (may still use rail or hand-holding)
- Getting on and off equipment smoothly with fewer falls
- Motor planning visible in choosing hand/foot placements
- Increasing height and complexity of climbed structures
- Emerging caution awareness (but still impulsive about climbing)

Why it matters:
- Builds significant upper and lower body strength
- Develops bilateral coordination and motor planning
- Supports spatial awareness and body position understanding
- Provides proprioceptive input important for body awareness
- Natural way children test capabilities and build confidence
- Requires close supervision as climbing ability exceeds safety judgment, necessitating childproofing and boundary setting

---

#### Jumps confidently

About

Between 2-3 years, toddlers master jumping with both feet leaving the ground, landing with control, and showing increasing confidence, distance, and height. According to motor milestone research, jumping requires significant leg strength, coordination, balance, rhythm, and motor planning. Initial jumps at 2 years may be small with both feet barely leaving ground, progressing by age 3 to confident jumps forward, off low heights, over obstacles, and repeated jumping for play. Jumping develops through stages: two-foot takeoff and landing on same spot, jumping forward, jumping off low steps, and eventually jumping over objects. Arm movements become incorporated for momentum and balance.

What to look for:
- Both feet leaving ground simultaneously
- Controlled landing without falling (most of the time)
- Jumping forward several inches
- Jumping off low steps or platforms (6-12 inches)
- Repeated jumping for play and exploration
- Bending knees appropriately for takeoff and landing
- Using arms for momentum and balance during jumps

Why it matters:
- Demonstrates significant leg strength and power
- Develops coordination, balance, and motor planning
- Foundation for more complex movements including hopping and skipping
- Supports cardiovascular fitness and active play
- Builds confidence in body capabilities
- Provides proprioceptive and vestibular input supporting sensory integration

---

#### Pedals tricycle

About

Around 2.5-3 years, many toddlers develop the complex coordination to pedal a tricycle, combining bilateral leg coordination (alternating leg movements), steering (hand-eye coordination and spatial awareness), and dynamic balance. According to motor development research, pedaling requires coordinating circular leg movements in opposition, maintaining trunk stability while legs move, steering to navigate path, and integrating all these components simultaneously. Some children pedal easily by 2.5 years while others don't master this until age 4—both represent normal developmental variation. Initial pedaling may be choppy or inconsistent, smoothing with practice into fluid circular movements.

What to look for:
- Alternating leg movements in circular pedaling motion
- Sustaining pedaling for several rotations without stopping
- Coordinating pedaling with steering (initially may do one or the other)
- Feet staying on pedals through rotation cycle
- Increasing speed and endurance with practice
- Navigating simple paths or around obstacles
- Progression from push-with-feet to true pedaling

Why it matters:
- Develops bilateral motor coordination and motor planning
- Builds leg strength and cardiovascular endurance
- Supports spatial awareness and navigation skills
- Foundation for eventual bicycle riding
- Provides independent mobility and confidence
- Wide normal variation in acquisition—lack of pedaling by age 3 is not concerning if other motor skills progressing

---

#### Runs

About

Between 2-3 years, toddlers develop mature running patterns with a true flight phase (both feet briefly off ground), improved speed, control, balance, and ability to navigate while running. According to gross motor research, mature running includes arm swing in opposition to legs, forward trunk lean, longer stride length, and coordinated rhythm. Two-year-olds run somewhat stiffly with shorter strides; by age 3, running appears more fluid and controlled. Toddlers enjoy running for pleasure, in games, and as primary means of getting places quickly. Falls still occur but decrease as balance and control improve. Running supports cardiovascular fitness, leg strength, and overall physical development.

What to look for:
- Clear flight phase with both feet off ground
- Coordinated arm swing opposite to leg movements
- Running at varying speeds with some control
- Ability to stop and change direction (improving but not fully mature)
- Running on varied surfaces and terrains
- Decreased frequency of falls compared to younger running
- Using running functionally and in play

Why it matters:
- Demonstrates advancing gross motor coordination and control
- Provides vigorous physical activity supporting overall health
- Develops leg strength, cardiovascular endurance, and balance
- Essential for active play, games, and peer interaction
- Foundation for more complex motor skills including sports
- Supports proprioceptive and vestibular development

---

#### Uses stairs

About

Between 2-3 years, toddlers progress in stair navigation from using both feet per step while holding support to alternating feet (one foot per step) going up stairs by age 2.5-3, with alternating feet going down developing closer to 3-4 years. According to motor milestone guidelines, stair use demonstrates balance, leg strength, motor planning, spatial awareness, and bilateral coordination. Two-year-olds typically go upstairs using both feet per step (marking time) while holding rail or hand; by age 3, many alternate feet going up. Descending stairs with alternating feet is more challenging and develops later. Adult-sized stairs are harder than shorter child-sized stairs.

What to look for:
- Progressing from both-feet-per-step to alternating feet ascending
- Using handrail or wall for support initially
- Decreasing need for hand-holding from caregiver
- Improved confidence and speed on stairs
- Looking at feet and steps less frequently (improving automaticity)
- Descending stairs safely, typically both feet per step at this age
- Appropriate caution showing emerging safety awareness

Why it matters:
- Critical functional skill for home and community independence
- Demonstrates balance, strength, and motor planning development
- Supports spatial awareness and body position understanding
- Shows progressive motor skill refinement over time
- Important safety skill requiring ongoing supervision and practice
- Stair gates should remain until skill is consistent and reliable

---

#### Walks

About

By 2-3 years, toddlers have transitioned from newly acquired walking to mature walking patterns with improved balance, coordination, efficiency, and adaptability. According to gait development research, mature walking includes heel-strike, smooth weight transfer, toe push-off, reciprocal arm swing, narrow base of support (feet closer together), and consistent rhythm. Two-to-three-year-olds walk confidently on various surfaces, carry objects while walking, walk backward, walk on tiptoes briefly, and adjust pace and direction smoothly. Walking is now the primary comfortable mode of movement, used automatically without conscious effort in most situations. Refinements in gait pattern continue through early childhood.

What to look for:
- Smooth, coordinated walking pattern with narrow base
- Heel-to-toe foot contact pattern
- Reciprocal arm swing
- Ability to walk on various surfaces (carpet, tile, grass, gravel)
- Walking while carrying objects or toys
- Smooth speed changes and direction changes
- Walking long distances without tiring quickly

Why it matters:
- Indicates gross motor development progressing typically
- Provides independent mobility for exploration and daily activities
- Foundation for all more complex motor skills
- Supports participation in family and community activities
- Enables peer interaction through mobile play
- Persistent immature gait patterns, frequent falling, or avoidance of walking warrants evaluation

## 36-48 MONTHS

### DEVELOPMENTAL - Gross Motor Skills

#### Climbs well

About

Between 3-4 years, children become skilled climbers, navigating playground equipment, ladders, climbing structures, and obstacles with increasing confidence, planning, and emerging safety awareness. According to gross motor development, climbing at this age involves sophisticated motor planning (planning multi-step sequences), bilateral coordination (alternating hand-hand, foot-foot movements), dynamic balance (maintaining balance during movement transitions), and spatial problem-solving (determining hand and foot placements). Children can climb ladders with alternating feet, navigate complex playground equipment with multiple levels and challenges, and show improving judgment about feasible vs. too-difficult climbs, though supervision remains essential.

What to look for:
- Confident climbing on playground equipment of appropriate height
- Alternating hand and foot movements on ladders and climbing structures
- Motor planning visible in pausing to assess route before climbing
- Successfully navigating equipment requiring sequences (climb ladder, cross bridge, go down slide)
- Appropriate caution emerging (though still needs supervision)
- Variety of climbing challenges attempted and mastered
- Rare falls or difficulty compared to younger climbing

Why it matters:
- Demonstrates significant strength, coordination, and motor planning
- Supports spatial reasoning and problem-solving skills
- Builds confidence and age-appropriate risk-taking in safe contexts
- Provides important proprioceptive and vestibular sensory input
- Supports social play as playground climbing is often social activity
- Continues to require supervision as risk assessment still developing

---

#### Hops on one foot

About

Around 3-4 years, children develop the balance, strength, and coordination to hop on one foot multiple times consecutively. According to motor milestone research, hopping requires single-leg strength, dynamic balance (maintaining balance during movement), motor planning, and rhythm. Most children begin hopping 1-3 times on one foot around age 3, progressing to 4-6+ consecutive hops by age 4. One foot may be easier than the other initially, with proficiency developing on both sides over time. Hopping is more challenging than jumping (two feet) because all weight and propulsion come from one leg while maintaining balance.

What to look for:
- Hopping on one foot 1-3+ times by age 3
- Progressing to 4-10 consecutive hops by age 4
- Both feet eventually achieving hopping, though one may lead
- Using arms for balance
- Hopping forward rather than just in place (emerging)
- Incorporating hopping into play (hopscotch games emerging)
- Rhythm and control improving with practice

Why it matters:
- Demonstrates significant single-leg balance and strength
- Shows motor planning and coordination advancing
- Foundation for skipping and more complex motor patterns
- Important gross motor milestone indicating typical development
- Supports participation in games and activities with peers
- Some children achieve this earlier or later—wide normal range exists

#### Runs around obstacles

About

Between 3-4 years, children can run confidently while navigating around obstacles, demonstrating sophisticated integration of visual information, motor planning, spatial awareness, speed control, and coordination. According to motor development research, running with obstacle avoidance requires visual scanning ahead, planning path adjustments, maintaining running rhythm while adjusting course, and coordinating upper and lower body to change direction. Children navigate around furniture, playground equipment, other children, and various obstacles without significant slowing, colliding, or falling. This represents advancing executive function (planning), visual-motor integration, and dynamic balance.

What to look for:
- Running confidently in environments with furniture or obstacles
- Adjusting path while maintaining running speed
- Visual scanning ahead to anticipate obstacles
- Smooth direction changes without stopping completely
- Running safely among peers without frequent collisions
- Navigating complex environments like playgrounds while running
- Decreasing falls or crashes compared to younger running

Why it matters:
- Demonstrates visual-motor integration and spatial processing
- Shows motor planning and executive function developing
- Critical for safe navigation in real-world environments
- Enables participation in active play, tag games, and peer activities
- Indicates balance and coordination advancing appropriately
- Supports confidence in movement abilities

#### Throws ball overhand

About

Around 3-4 years, children develop the coordination to throw a ball overhand with step-forward and follow-through motion, showing increasing accuracy, distance, and mature throwing pattern. According to motor development research, mature overhand throwing involves trunk rotation, stepping forward with opposite foot, arm coming from behind head, release at appropriate point, and follow-through across body. Three-year-olds may show components of this pattern; by age 4, most children demonstrate recognizable overhand throwing with forward step. Accuracy and distance improve significantly with practice. This motor pattern involves sequencing body movements (step, rotate, throw) and timing release for accuracy.

What to look for:
- Overhand arm motion (from above or behind head, not underhand)
- Stepping forward with opposite foot (initially may step with same foot)
- Trunk rotation toward target
- Follow-through motion after release
- Throwing with purpose toward general target area
- Increasing distance and accuracy over this period
- Practice and engagement in throwing activities

Why it matters:
- Demonstrates complex motor planning and sequencing
- Foundation for ball sports and physical activities
- Shows cross-body coordination (stepping with opposite foot)
- Supports hand-eye coordination development
- Provides opportunity for parent-child and peer play
- Wide variation in throwing skill—gender differences often appear due to practice opportunities

### TEETH - Eruption

#### Jaw/facial bones growing, creating spaces (normal for permanent teeth)

About

Between ages 3-6, children's jaw and facial bones grow significantly in preparation for permanent teeth, which are larger than primary teeth. According to pediatric dentistry, this growth often creates spacing between primary teeth, particularly upper front teeth and between canines and molars. These "developmental spaces" or "primate spaces" are normal, beneficial, and actually indicate appropriate jaw growth. The spaces provide room for future permanent teeth and typically appear after age 3. Parents may notice gaps appearing between previously touching primary teeth. This spacing is expected and not cause for concern—in fact, absence of spacing may indicate insufficient jaw growth that could lead to crowding of permanent teeth.

What to look for:
- Gaps developing between primary teeth, especially upper front teeth
- Spaces particularly noticeable between canines and first molars
- Previously touching teeth now having visible gaps
- Spacing increasing gradually between ages 3-6
- Overall jaw appearing larger and face lengthening
- Primary teeth still stable and healthy despite spacing
- Changes occurring gradually over months/years

Why it matters:
- Indicates normal jaw and facial growth
- Creates necessary space for larger permanent teeth
- Reduces likelihood of crowding when permanent teeth erupt
- Reassures parents that spacing is positive, not problematic
- Lack of spacing may indicate future orthodontic concerns
- Distinguishes normal developmental spacing from spacing due to tooth loss or other issues

#### All 20 primary teeth present

About

By 36-48 months, most children have all 20 primary teeth fully erupted, completing the primary dentition that began around 6 months with first incisors. According to pediatric dental guidelines, the complete primary dentition includes 10 upper teeth (4 incisors, 2 canines, 4 molars) and 10 lower teeth (4 incisors, 2 canines, 4 molars). These teeth typically remain until age 6-7 when permanent teeth begin replacing them, starting with first molars and central incisors. Primary teeth are critical for chewing, speech development, maintaining space for permanent teeth, and jaw development. Proper oral hygiene including brushing twice daily and dental visits every 6 months is important.

What to look for:
- Complete set of 20 teeth: 8 incisors (4 upper, 4 lower), 4 canines (2 upper, 2 lower), 8 molars (4 upper, 4 lower)
- All teeth fully erupted through gums
- Teeth functional for chewing all food textures
- Regular dental checkups established (recommended every 6 months)
- Proper oral hygiene routine: brushing twice daily with fluoride toothpaste
- No signs of cavities, decay, or dental pain
- Age-appropriate speech development supported by complete dentition

Why it matters:
- Complete primary dentition essential for proper nutrition through effective chewing
- Primary teeth maintain space for permanent teeth and guide their eruption
- Critical for speech sound development, particularly sounds like f, v, th, s
- Supports jaw growth and development
- Establishes oral hygiene habits important for lifelong dental health
- Primary tooth decay can affect developing permanent teeth, making preventive care crucial

## 48-60 MONTHS

### DEVELOPMENTAL - Gross Motor Skills

#### Does somersaults

About

Around 4-5 years, children develop the coordination, body awareness, and confidence to perform somersaults (forward rolls). According to motor development research, somersaults require tucking the chin, rounding the back, pushing off with legs, rolling smoothly over the back, and returning to standing or sitting position. This movement involves spatial awareness in unusual positions, core strength, coordination, overcoming fear of inversion, and motor sequencing. Some children find somersaults easy and enjoyable; others are hesitant or uncomfortable with inverted positions. Both represent normal variation. Proper technique (tucked chin) is important for safety. This is often learned through imitation, gymnastics, or physical education.

What to look for:
- Attempting forward rolls with tucked chin and rounded back
- Smooth rolling motion over back from crouch to sitting/standing
- Demonstrating understanding of body positioning needed
- Overcoming initial hesitation about inverted position
- Practice improving smoothness and control
- Eventually performing somersaults with minimal assistance
- May prefer this activity or avoid it based on temperament

Why it matters:
- Demonstrates body awareness in space including inverted positions
- Shows coordination, core strength, and motor planning
- Builds confidence with body movement in unusual orientations
- Supports vestibular development (balance system)
- Common component of gymnastics and physical education
- Not all children enjoy inversions—forcing is not recommended

#### Skips

About

Around 4-5 years, children learn to skip—a complex movement pattern involving step-hop on alternating feet with rhythmic timing. According to motor milestone research, skipping is one of the most complex gross motor skills of early childhood, requiring bilateral coordination (alternating sides), rhythm, balance during single-leg hop phase, and motor sequencing. Children typically progress through galloping (leading with same foot) before achieving true skipping with alternating step-hops. Many children don't master skipping until age 5-6, with significant normal variation. Skipping involves coordination similar to walking but with added hop, making it substantially more challenging.

What to look for:
- Step-hop pattern on alternating feet (right step-hop, left step-hop)
- Rhythmic timing maintained across several skips
- Arms swinging in coordination with legs
- Forward progression while skipping
- Progression from galloping (one-sided) to true alternating skip
- Smooth transitions between sides
- Enjoyment and practice improving proficiency

Why it matters:
- One of most complex motor milestones of early childhood
- Demonstrates bilateral coordination, rhythm, and motor planning
- Shows balance sufficient for single-leg hop phase
- Wide normal variation—many children don't skip until age 5-6 or later
- Not predictive of motor concerns if delayed—some children skip late despite typical development
- Often learned through observation, songs, and games

#### Stands on one foot 10+ seconds

About

By age 4-5, children can balance on one foot for 10 or more seconds, demonstrating excellent static balance and core strength. According to developmental milestones, standing balance on one foot progresses from 1-2 seconds at age 2, to 3-5 seconds at age 3, to 5-10 seconds at age 4, to 10+ seconds by age 5. This skill requires strength in the standing leg, core stability, vestibular function (inner ear balance), visual input, proprioception (body position sense), and concentration. Children may use arm movements for balance initially. Balance ability on one foot is important for many functional activities including dressing (standing to put on pants), sports, and play activities.

What to look for:
- Standing on one foot for 10+ seconds by age 5
- Minimal wobbling or arm flailing
- Ability to stand on both feet with similar proficiency
- Maintaining balance without visual focus on foot (eyes can be on other things)
- May use arms initially for balance
- Concentration visible but becoming more automatic
- Incorporating into games and activities (freeze dance, flamingo pose)

Why it matters:
- Indicates mature balance systems integration (vestibular, visual, proprioceptive)
- Demonstrates core strength and single-leg stability
- Essential for many functional activities including dressing
- Foundation for sports and physical activities
- Shows body awareness and control
- Significant difficulty with balance by age 5 may warrant evaluation

#### Uses fork/spoon competently

About

By age 4-5, children use fork and spoon with mature grasp (not fisted), good control, appropriate food loading, and minimal spilling, feeding themselves independently. According to occupational therapy and self-care milestones, competent utensil use involves mature grasp with fingers (tripod or digital grasp rather than fisted palmar grasp), scooping and spearing food effectively, bringing utensil to mouth without spilling most of the time, and using utensils throughout meals rather than reverting to fingers. By this age, children can manage most foods including scooping rice or pasta, spearing vegetables or meat, and using utensils in social settings. Some mess is still expected, but dramatic improvement from toddler eating is evident.

What to look for:
- Mature grasp on utensils (fingers, not fisted in palm)
- Successful scooping of various food textures
- Effective spearing with fork
- Bringing food to mouth without significant spilling
- Using utensils throughout meals independently
- Appropriate utensil choice for different foods
- Socially appropriate eating with utensils in various settings

Why it matters:
- Demonstrates fine motor coordination and hand-eye coordination
- Indicates self-care skills and independence progressing
- Important for social eating situations and school meals
- Shows maturation of grasp patterns
- Enables participation in family and social meals
- Foundation for more advanced utensil skills including knife use for cutting

### HEARING - Development

#### Should have hearing screening before school

About

Children should receive hearing screening before starting kindergarten (ages 4-5) to identify any hearing problems that could affect learning, language development, social interactions, and academic performance. According to AAP and ASHA guidelines, even mild hearing loss can significantly impact speech development, following instructions, phonological awareness (important for reading), and classroom learning. Preschool screening tests various frequencies and volumes in both ears. In addition to birth screening, children should have periodic hearing checks, especially if history of ear infections, family history of hearing loss, or any concerns about hearing or speech. Many schools require documentation of hearing screening for kindergarten entry.

What to look for (Signs of potential hearing concerns):
- Frequently saying "what?" or asking for repetition
- Speaking louder than necessary
- Difficulty following directions, particularly in noisy environments
- Speech delays or articulation difficulties
- Turning up volume on television or devices
- Watching speakers' faces intently
- Difficulty with phonological awareness tasks (rhyming, sound identification)

Why it matters:
- Even mild hearing loss significantly impacts learning and language
- Early identification allows for intervention before school challenges develop
- Hearing affects phonological awareness critical for reading development
- May identify chronic ear fluid, wax buildup, or permanent hearing loss
- Establishes baseline for future monitoring
- Required by many schools for kindergarten entry
- Undetected hearing loss is a common cause of learning and behavior difficulties

### VISION - Development

#### Should have vision screening before school

About

Children should receive comprehensive vision screening before starting kindergarten (ages 4-5) to identify any vision problems that could affect learning, reading development, hand-eye coordination, and classroom participation. According to AAP and American Academy of Ophthalmology guidelines, preschool vision screening tests visual acuity (clarity), eye alignment, depth perception, color vision, and overall eye health. Many vision problems including amblyopia (lazy eye), strabismus (eye misalignment), and refractive errors (nearsightedness, farsightedness, astigmatism) can be effectively treated if identified early but become more difficult to correct if detected after age 6-7. First comprehensive eye exam recommended by age 3, with screening before school entry.

What to look for (Signs of potential vision concerns):
- Squinting, eye rubbing, or excessive blinking
- Closing or covering one eye
- Tilting head to see better
- Sitting very close to television or holding books very close
- Difficulty with eye-hand coordination tasks (catching, threading beads)
- Avoiding coloring, puzzles, or visual detail activities
- Complaining of headaches or tired eyes
- Eyes appearing misaligned or one eye turning in/out

Why it matters:
- Undetected vision problems significantly impact school readiness and learning
- Critical period for treating amblyopia closes around age 7-8
- Early identification and treatment of eye misalignment prevents permanent vision loss
- Vision problems affect reading development, writing, math, and all academic areas
- Impacts behavior, attention, and social interaction in classroom
- Many vision problems have no obvious symptoms but affect learning
- Required by many schools for kindergarten entry
- Children may not know their vision is abnormal or how to describe it
